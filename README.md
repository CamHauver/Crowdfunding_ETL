An ETL pipeline project (extract, transform, load) on crowdfunding data. Data is extracted and transformed using Python and Pandas. This project also includes ERD and table schema creation. Data is also loaded into a Postgres database. 

Original code sources: 
Data Analytics course Project 2 ETL files, including starter code
Data Analytics course instructor, Andrew Hoang's, speed run Zoom recording for Project 2

See ETL_Project_CHauver.ipynb for data extraction, transformation, and loading code within jupyter notebook

Data has been modeled by creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (crowdfunding_ERD.png, qdbERD.txt) using an online tool; QuickDBD (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) found in resources folder.

Data has been engineered into a SQL database across multiple tables (crowdfunding_schema.sql) found in resources folder
